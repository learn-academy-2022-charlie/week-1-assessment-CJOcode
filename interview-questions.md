  Your answer: Index's are the place holders inside of arrays. For example, Inside of an array as such, var num = [7, 9, 10, 11], index 0 would be equal to 7, index 1 would be equal to 9 and so on. So, we can use those index positions to call on which number/s we would like to use in our code

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: 
  
  Iteration is used when using loops, in a assignment I had this week I used iteration when creating a for loop that would run through the numbers 1 through 20. As it ran through the process of numbers the output would display "odd" for every odd number and keep the evens as numbers.

  Researched answer: 
  
  Iteration is the name of the actual process that takes place when running the for loop. It preforms the action that you want your loop to run for the amount of time you designate it to or until a condition that you set is met.
